# Modeling_Funding_of_Kickstarter_Games

I've become an avid board gamer in the last couple of years. One source for finding the latest and (maybe) greatest board games is the crowdfunding platform, Kickstarter. If enough money is pledge by backers, they can help make a new board game a reality.

For this project, I scraped tabletop games data from kickstarter.com to model funding using regression techniques and try to see what features might influence the success of a board game Kickstarter campaign.
