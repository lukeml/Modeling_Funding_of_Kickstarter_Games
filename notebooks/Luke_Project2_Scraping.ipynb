You play as a group of high school students at Camelot University who, after discovering their extraordinary magical powers, are thrust headfirst into a battle to save two worlds from the mad ambitions of the Night King.  The Twilight Dream is a secret world of magic and monsters, sky islands and scheming elven queens.  Europa meanwhile is a land in the midst of great change as new technologies rapidly transform life for her people.  Railways, ice cream, electricity and motion pictures exist side-by-side with kings and castles.  It is an exciting time, full of interesting characters and new opportunities, and most of all – adventure!\n",
      "The world of The Twilight Dream was inspired by the rich stories of Gaelic, Celtic and Brythonic folklore and mythology.  It also borrows from Norse, north German, and later Christian traditions.  The story is set in a time period roughly equivalent to the late American Wild West, a time of great societal change as technology brought humanity into the modern era.  It was my intention when making this setting to capture the spirit of the source material in a way that was respectful to the original cultures and traditions, while not being strictly defined by their history.  Lovers of history and mythology will find many nods to familiar characters and stories reimagined for our fantastical world.\n",
      "By supporting our campaign on Kickstarter, you are helping us to bring this world to life through artwork created by our team.  Campaign funding goes to the art budget for the book, and the more available funding we have, the more wonderful artwork our team can can create for the book.\n",
      "This book features original artwork, new classes, backgrounds, magic items, spells, sinister villains, monsters and more.  Join us on our adventure in The Twilight Dream!\n",
      "Cover art by Przemyslaw Gul. The Night King and his minions menace our heroes.\n",
      "A World of Mystery and Adventure\n",
      "A magical barrier known as the veil separates the dreaming world from the waking world. Creatures can step between worlds by walking through magical reflective surfaces like enchanted mirrors, waterfalls, or giant cut agates. Most of these gateways only work during twilight hours. The Fey are spirits from the dreaming world that take physical form when they cross the veil, usually as young women. They find physical existence alien and often frightening but exhilarating. They are drawn to feed on the dreams, desires and emotions of creatures in the waking world. Most spirits do not willingly cause harm because they do not understand the consequences of their actions or the concept of good and evil. Other creatures cross the veil to cause mischief and harm.\n",
      "Several secret societies exist in the waking world to monitor visitors from the dream, destroy harmful creatures, and maintain the dream’s hidden existence. The Vanguard is one such organization. The Vanguard built the Sanctum where the players first discovered their powers. The knights of the Vanguard were formerly the greatest protectors of both worlds until the order fell into ruin 200 years ago. The Vanguard today is on the brink of collapse, its knights disillusioned with their goal, their ancient fortresses crumbling and looted by the malevolent elves of the Unseelie Court.\n",
      "The Vanguard formed long ago to combat the black mist, Miasma, which reaches out to consume the Twilight Dream. Miasma is a primordial mindless force of darkness, destruction and decay. Every few centuries its power surges and the Vanguard calls upon heroes to complete a series of trials to push it back. But 200 years ago their heroes failed, as they have every time since, and every time the Miasma has grown stronger. The darkness has found a champion in the Night King, a devilishly handsome man who possesses terrifying power. Creatures of the Twilight Dream live in fear of the baleful gaze of his one open eye. His generals rule large swathes of the dream poisoned by Miasma.\n",
      "It is up to our heroes to restore the fallen Vanguard, unravel the mysteries of the past, and overcome the threats to both worlds.\n",
      "By Lucjan Pakulski. The mischievous boggart is one of many types of trolls you will meet in the dreaming world. They can eat almost anything. They especially like the taste of shiny things, like beetles or silverware.\n",
      "Product Features\n",
      "The adventure takes place over the course of several school years.  To cover this vast amount of time, the school year is broken up into calendar weeks and weekends.  During the week characters attend class, study, train their skills, socialize and take part in other activities as normal high school students.  During the weekends they have free time to visit town, rest and recover, find employment, go out with friends, and travel to the dreaming world.  They could always sneak out and leave school grounds to visit the dreaming world during the week, too, but they should be prepared to face the consequences if they are caught.  The world changes as the seasons come and go, bringing new opportunities and new perils.  The Gloaming Court does not sit idle.  The villain's schemes advance every week until they are ready to be unleashed upon the heroes.  It is up to you to balance your studies, social life, and adventures.\n",
      "The Twilight Dream uses a brand new system for casting spells.  Spell Slots represent a character’s reserves of magical power used to cast arcane and martial spells.  Arcane Spells are sorceries that manipulate the fabric of reality.  Martial Spells raise the caster's physical abilities to superhuman levels.  Every character has a limited number of spells they can cast each day before they must rest to regain their power.  Furthermore, the all new spells in this book can be cast at any level.  Casting a spell at a higher level increases its effectiveness and allows the caster to add one spell improvement per level above first.  Spell improvements are unique to each spell, offering tons of options for players to customize their magic.  A fireball at first level may be a simple fiery explosion, but at third level you can turn it into twin magma fireball that leaves behind two pools of burning magma!\n",
      "Adventures in the dreaming world are not only harrowing but exhausting.  Your heroes will often find they need to rest while their enemies grow stronger.  Thankfully you are not fighting alone.  In this setting each player controls two or more characters that they can switch between to form squads.  A squad is a team of heroes that set out together on an adventure, but it is only part of the larger group.  The characters meet up at the Sanctum that serves as their hidden home base where they can equip their gear and gather information from the Sanctum Keeper, Morrigan.  She is a constant ally to the players who provides what aid she can, such as casting ritual spells and opening the portal for them to enter the dreaming world.  The players can improve the Sanctum and strengthen Morrigan's powers by recovering rare and powerful artifacts.  In time the players' small party can potentially grow to include many characters and NPCs as they restore the Vanguard to its former glory.\n",
      "By Shelby Mock. The Night Angel is one sub-class for the new Starlight Guardian class. Their signature class feature allows these young women to transform into celestial heroes.\n",
      "Rules Changes and New Races\n",
      "This book uses the D20 rules system of fifth edition Dungeons & Dragons with some changes made to the core system to better suit the fantasy.\n",
      "Health and damage growth for players and monsters have been reduced to increase the lethality of combat and create more tense encounters.  This also decreases the raw stat gap between characters of all levels.  Almost all abilities can be taken at any time, growing in power automatically as the character gains levels in their class, which also decreases the mechanical gap between characters of any given level.  This empowers players to do cool bespoke things with their characters.  It is highly recommended that DMs running games in this setting use accelerated growth for player levels.\n",
      "Normal rolls of the six-sided (d6) and eight-sided (d8) dice follow a special rule to produce superior results; rolls of 1-3 on the d6 are treated as though you rolled a 3, and rolls of 1-4 on the d8 are treated as though you rolled a 4.\n",
      "Long rests no longer restore spent Hit Dice.  Characters must spend a full weekend resting to fully recover their Hit Dice and spell slots.  This encourages players to switch characters going on adventures or to increase tension as they push for a time-sensitive objective with a wounded hero.\n",
      "The standard races have been replaced by tribes that function similarly.  Other D&D race options are permissible within this setting as rare members of the \"lost tribes,\" at your DM's discretion.\n",
      "The people of Europa belong to a unique offshoot of humanity known as the Firbolg. Children look very different from the adults, even their own parents, due to a transformation their people undergo during puberty. Children are born with large eyes and slightly pointed ears – some rare individuals have tails. Young people begin to develop the characteristics of adult Firbolgs at the age of eleven to thirteen. This transformation is radically different for each individual. Adult Firbolgs belong to one of four tribes based on their mature features: dracaryn, dwarf, goblin, and human. All tribes except the humans have sub-tribes with additional characteristics.\n",

      "Regicide is a card game that can be played with a standard deck of 52 cards plus 2 jokers. The game rules are available here, so feel free to try out Regicide yourself by just grabbing any old deck of cards you might have lying around! We also have a learn to play video at the bottom of this page if you want to see it in action. So why back this project if you can just play Regicide with a standard deck of cards? We think this Regicide deck adds a new level of excitement and immersion while also communicating the key game concepts. Why play a boring 2 of Spades when you could instead play a cute Gnome wielding an oversized cheese cutter?\n",
      "The art is beautifully crafted by the amazing Sketchgoblin, who has extensive experience illustrating many kinds of strange and wonderful fantasy characters. Each of the 54 cards is brought to life with vivid illustrations depicting a diverse cast of intriguing characters and wildlife. The four suits represent different classes while each number represents a race. The Jacks, Queens and Kings are the fearsome enemies that the players must defeat. The game also includes a handy player guide card which reminds the players of the key game concepts. The final product is a deck of cards with which you can play not only Regicide, but any other standard card game too. Whip it out for a game of Poker or Hearts with an above average number of Dwarves and Pangolins!\n",
      "Be warned: this game is challenging! During the testing and balancing stage we played many hundreds of games both between ourselves and with other unwitting volunteers. Through this testing we found the game was no cakewalk. But do not fear, the game is fast to setup, fast to play, and you'll learn valuable lessons from each crushing defeat. Defeated? Just shuffle up and try again! When you finally take out that fourth King high fives with your regicidal comrades is guaranteed.\n",
      "Regicide will be manufactured by MakePlayingCards.com (MPC®), a branded playing cards and card games manufacturing company with over 35 years history. The cards have a beautiful linen finish and a gloss coating. The casino-quality black core card stock means that you'll have a durable deck that feels great to shuffle and play.\n",
